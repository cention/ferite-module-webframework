				&webframework; is an advanced web application development framework written in the &ferite; programming
				language. The framework provides a number of sophisticated layers on which to build excellent web applications.
				These include flexible user interface components, an advanced zone based security layer, sanitised urls,
				a stored object based database layer, great internationalisation support, page designer and developer friendly
				structure, versioning document layer and most of all, a clean model-view-controller design.

			<title id="intro-background.title">Background</title>
			<para>
				Chris Ross, the author of &ferite;, wrote &webframework; as a mechanism for developing and maintaining complex
				web applications in the modern world wide web. It provides a very different method for web development and 
				removes much of the repetitive nature of writing web sites.

			&webframework; requires the latest &ferite; release (1.1.0) which includes directives. It also relies on the modules:
			xslt, template, image, dbi and embfer. It will not work without these modules. They can be found in the top-level 
			modules directory in ferite cvs. Or upon release, on the download site. You will also need either MySQL or PosgreSQL
			installed and have a database set up for use within the system. We strongly recommend PostgreSQL for use with 
			webframework. You will also need <monospace>apache</monospace> 2.x running <monospace>mod_ferite</monospace> (the apache
			module).

			Configuration.feh.sample is where you start. This can be found within the Server/Support/ directory within the

				<list-item><para>
					Root: This is the root of the &webframework;installation on the web server. It is safe to leave this blank unless you wish &webframework; to 
					bind to a specific name. For instance "http://www.foobar.com".
				</para></list-item>
				<list-item><para>
					RootOffset: How to reach the top-level &webframework; directory from the host. For instance, if you installed &webframework; into the
					top level document directory of your web-server, you would put "webframework" in this field.
				</para></list-item>
				<list-item><para>
					AppDefault: If you are only going to have one application, it's name should be placed here and &webframework; will always route non-specific
					requests to the application. However, if you have multiple applications, you can leave this blank and &webframework; will provide an application
					list.
				</para></list-item>
				<list-item><para>
					FSDataDirectory: &webframework; provides some data services that allow applications to generate, store and retrieve information during run-time
					making it easier to manage the multiple application design nature of the system. This is the disk path to the data directory. It is suggested that
					this directory is placed within the &webframework; top level directory.
				</para></list-item>
				<list-item><para>
					URLDataDirectory: The dual to FSDataDirectory, this is the web accessible path to the afore mentioned data directory. This should be an absolute
					path from the root of the web site.
				</para></list-item>
				<list-item><para>
					Debug: If this <monospace>boolean</monospace> variable is set to <monospace>true</monospace>, &webframework; will operate within debug mode
					injecting various tools at the top of each page.

			Once you have configured your database connection you can run the <monospace>TestDB.fe</monospace> script in the tools directory.

			If everything is working well, you will have a the above message stating that all is well. If everything has gone wrong, you will get
			something that looks like this:

' </code>
		<para>
			This will also flag any issues with module loading that might inhibit &webframework;'s ability to run. 
			There are two other things we must do before we test the framework. You must check that the top-level <monospace>Cache</monospace> and data
			directories are write-able by the web-server. Once that is done, we can now test that the webframework
			is working, by directing our browser at the web-server. You need to simply go to the root or the &webframework; directory and you should
			see something like this.

			The application list is the set of basic applications that come with &webframework;, we will ignore those for the moment and create an application 
			to play with.

		<section id="localconfig">
			<title id="localconfig.title">Local Configuration: Application Specific Values</title>
			<para>
				There are times when you wish to host multiple applications within the same webframework installation but have different default values. For
				instance you may want debugging turned on for a particular application and have the others working in production mode, or have a particular
				application using a different database. This can be achieved using the <monospace>LocalConfiguration.feh</monospace> file within the applications's
				<monospace>Support</monospace> directory. You may also want to setup some global configuration for that application and not have it appear in
				another application, either way, this mechanism provides a nice clean way of doing things.
			</para>
			<para>
				You need to create a file called <monospace>LocalConfiguration.feh</monospace> and create a namespace within it called <monospace>LocalConfig</monospace>.
				This file should have the same structure as the standard <monospace>Configuration.feh</monospace> file, but only contain the values you wish 
				to <emphasis>overwrite</emphasis> or add the the <monospace>Config</monospace> namespace. For instance, if I want the application to connect to a
				different database, I would fill the file with:
			</para>
			<code>
namespace LocalConfig {
	string DbType = "pgsql";
	string DbUsername = "chris";
	string DbPassword = "";
	string DbHost = "localhost";
	string DbDatabase = "arctic";
} </code>
			<para>
				If I wanted to turn on <monospace>Debug</monospace> for a particular application, I would use this:
			</para>
			<code>
namespace LocalConfig {
	boolean Debug = true;
} </code>
			<para>
				You do <emphasis>not</emphasis> need to include the <monospace>LocalConfiguration.feh</monospace> file, &webframework; will automatically import it if it exists.
			</para>

	<section id="basics">
		<title id="basics.title">Basics: Creating An Empty Application</title>
		<para>
			Creating a basic application is as easy as running a script. It will build the basic application, populate the database with the required tables,
			and register the security details. We shall create a task tracking application which we will call "tasks". In the &webframework; Tools directory, 
			we need to run the following script:
		</para>
		<code>Tools$ ferite CreateBasicApplication.fe -- tasks ../Applications/
Creating application 'tasks' in '../Applications/'
Writing out index.fe
Writing out App.fe
Writing out Main.page
Writing out Main.page.fe
Injecting SQL code for application
Done!</code>
		<para>
			We can now refresh our application list and our application should appear:
		</para>
		<image source="wf_applist_tasks.png"/>
		<para>
			Clicking on our application will take us to the application's main page: (Note the clean url)
		</para>
		<image source="wf_tasks_main.png"/>
		<para>
			We can even click on the button:
		</para>
		<image source="wf_tasks_main_clicked.png"/>
		<para>
			So there we have it: a basic application. The next set of sections will detail what the structure of the system is, what pages are and 
			how to make the application do something clever and useful with components and store objects.
		</para>
	</section>
	
	<section id="structure">
		<title id="structure.title">The Structure of an Application and the Server</title>
		<para>
			The most important idea behind &webframework;is that of structure. Keep things consistent and maintenance is made easier. Each application
			has a Pages, Resources and Support directory. 
		</para>
		<image source="wf_app_layout.png"/>
		<para>
			In each of these directories only specific things should appear:
			<list>
				<list-item>
					<para>
						Pages: This is the location of the component based pages and controller classes for the page. The only files that should be
						present within this directory are page files (<monospace>.page</monospace>) and page-controller files (<monospace>.page.fe</monospace>). 
						<monospace>Page</monospace> files are XML based documents that describe the look and layout of the page, these should, strictly 
						speaking be completely be clean of code. This is true 99% of the time with the 1% described later in this document. 
						<monospace>Page-Controller</monospace> files are the controller for the page files and provide the operating logic for the page. This
						separation is exceedingly important and provides a great environment for developers and designers to move freely within the
						application source without stepping on each others toes. Pages are covered within the next section and provide the interface 
						for the web applications.
					</para>
				</list-item>
				<list-item>
					<para>
						Resources: All static content should be placed within this directory and very much to a strict directory layout. &webframework; 
						does resource stacking. This means that part of the system can request a resource of a certain type, and &webframework; will first 
						look in the applications resource directory, if it exists the framework will use it, otherwise it'll then look for the resource
						in &webframework;. How is this useful ? Due to the large amount of resources that &webframework; provides - you can, and most likely
						will want to, override the defaults such as images, style or layout. It is as simple as placing a file in the resource directory
						of your application. For instance, to change the default html that is generated when a button is rendered - simply copy the webframework
						template, change it and then save it to the <monospace>Templates</monospace> directory within the <monospace>Resources</monospace> directory.
						Now, whenever a button is rendered, they will all use your new template as it will override the default one. The directories that
						are used are called <monospace>CSS</monospace> for css style sheets, <monospace>Images</monospace> for images, <monospace>Javascript</monospace>
						for javascript monospaces and <monospace>Templates</monospace> for templates (covered more within the section on Components).
					</para>
				</list-item>
				<list-item>
					<para>
						Support: Code goes here. We recommend that you place your code in this directory. &webframework; will not load any code automatically,
						so it in necessary to include your files. This approach is part of the defensive opt-in strategy &webframework; employs for various
						sections of the system which is explained in much more detail within the Security section of this document (In a nutshell: &webframework;
						keeps everything locked down by default and requires you, as the developer, to open up the system which should help reduce unforeseen
						security holes.) To keep with good organisation, it is also recommended that components are placed within the <monospace>Components</monospace>
						directory within <monospace>Support</monospace>.
					</para>
				</list-item>
			</list>
			The <monospace>App.fe</monospace> file is the core application file that provides the details to help the application run - such as page registration,
			application title, simple actions and redirects. We can check the anatomy of a basic <monospace>App.fe</monospace> file:
		</para>
		<code lines="on">// Automatically created by CreateBasicApplication.fe for BugTrack
class tasksApplication extends Application {
	constructor {
		super("tasks");

		.registerPage('Main');

		redirects.register( Application.NoAction, "Main" );
	}
}
return new tasksApplication();</code>
		<para>
			Line 2 shows the application class extending the <monospace>Application</monospace> class. Line 4 shows the constructor being called along with the
			name of the application. Line 6 shows the registration of the page <monospace>Main</monospace>. Line 8 is a standard line that tells &webframework; to
			redirect the <monospace>NoAction</monospace> request to <monospace>Main</monospace>. NoAction is generated when the application is called blind, e.g.
			<monospace>http://localhost/webframework/App.fe/tasks</monospace>. Line 11 returns an instance of our application class for the &webframework;to use.
		</para>
		<para>
			The <monospace>index.fe</monospace> simply does a force redirect to &webframework; if someone stumbles into the application directory. It looks like
			this:
		</para>
		<code>Request.current().location( "../../App.fe/tasks" );</code>
		<para>
			Server layout should be familiar:
		</para>
		<image source="wf_server_layout.png" />
		<para>
			Consistency. The key to an easy life. Well, easier. The server layout is identical to the application layout and all resources are shared
			between all applications. There are however much more resources within the Server directory and we suggest you take a look around. You will
			note the Page and Page-Controller files that are within the Server/Pages directory. If you want to overload the Login or Error page ?
			Provide a new Page file with the correctly name components - the logic does not need to be replaced.
		</para>
	</section>
	
	<section id="pages">
		<title id="pages.title">(Canadian) Pages: What are they all aboot ?</title>
		<para>
			We know they exist, we know where to put them, we <emphasis>even know</emphasis> that they are made up of two files - the layout 'Page' and
			the logic 'Controller'. First of all, we shall look at the files generated for us by <monospace>CreateBasicApplication.fe</monospace>, go
			through the main points of both files and then make a number of small modifications, then go in and start playing with the heavy machinery.
			Watch out, you should probably put your coffee down.
		</para>
		
		<section id="pages.page">
			<title>Page file:</title>
			<para>
				To build a page that looks like this:
			</para>
			<image source="wf_tasks_main.png"/>
			<para>
				You need a page file that looks like this:
			</para>			
			<code lines="on"><![CDATA[<!-- Automatically created by CreateBasicApplication.fe for tasks -->
<wf:Label ID="DocumentTitle" FontSize="24px" TextValue="Welcome to tasks" /> <br />
<wf:Button ID="ClickButton" TextValue="Click Me!" />
<wf:TextField ID="ClickField" />]]></code>
			<para>
				So, here we have a page file, there are 3 components detailed on this page, a <monospace>Label</monospace> on line 2, a <monospace>Button</monospace> 
				on line 3 and a <monospace>TextField</monospace> on line 4. These build the page and produce a page as seen above. The first thing to note, 
				these page files must be valid xml for &webframework;to parse them. This can be deemed strict but remember, we are aiming for high standards and easy 
				maintenance and as little sloppiness as possible. What does &webframework;do with the page file when loaded ? It first applies a header and footer
				from a defined template (detailed later), parses the produced page and builds the components, connects the components with the logic and executes any 
				code than needs to be run. Much of this process is cached and thus exceedingly fast on subsequent loads. Components are references by defining items within
				the <monospace>wf</monospace> xml namespace along with the name of the component. It you wish to access a component in the controller you will
				need to specify an identifier with the <monospace>ID</monospace> attribute. You can happily mix html and components with each other which is where
				the power comes - the developer can build a basic page with the components and then let the designer build the layout and tweak the interface, the
				designer only needs to know or define the ID's of the components being used. So, how do we make the page do something ? The controller.
			</para>

		<section id="pages.controller">
			<title>Page-Controller file:</title>
			<code lines="on">// Automatically created by CreateBasicApplication.fe for tasks
class MainPage extends GUIKit.Page {
	[component DocumentTitle]; // Automatically bound by webframework

	function initialiseComponents() {
		// Add Component initialisation code here
		.ClickButton.registerEventHook( self, "button_clicked", GUIKit.EvClick );
	}
	function button_clicked( object sender, string extra ) {
		.ClickField.setTextValue("You clicked!");
	}
}
return MainPage;</code>
			<para>
				A page controller is a class that extends a <monospace>GUIKit.Page</monospace>, has a set of <monospace>[component]</monospace> directives,
				a <monospace>initialiseComponents</monospace>, an optional <monospace>pageLoaded</monospace> function, a set of optional event handlers and
				a number of overloaded functions to drive how content is delivered to the client.
			</para>
			<para>
				In the above example you can see a number of <monospace>[component]</monospace> directives. These tell &webframework; to create variables
				called by the name in the directive and link it to the component within the page file with the same name. This allows you to transparently
				access the components within the layout as if they are instance variables - you do not need to manually locate and set them up. This can
				be seen by the variables use on line 9 and 12, when the button event handler has been setup and the text value of the edit box are done
				respectively.
			</para>
			<para>
				It is important to understand the way in which &webframework; processes a page to use them effectively. When it loads the page, it resets
				it to an initial state and calls <monospace>initialiseComponents</monospace>, where it is normal for a page controller to setup links for
				data sources, event handlers etc. If it is not the first load of the page for the specific client, (say a button has been clicked), the
				system will set all components to their previous state, update changed components. Then <monospace>pageLoaded</monospace> will be called.
				If there are any event handlers	it will invoke them, then the page will be built and delivered to the client.
			</para>
			<para>
				In the above example, we register a click handler on <monospace>ClickButton</monospace> on line 9 to call our <monospace>button_clicked</monospace>
				function. Our event handler (line 11) takes two arguments: the object that causes the event handler to be fired and a string <monospace>extra</monospace>
				which can be set when we register our event handler to be passed back to us. Within our event handler we change the text value of the 
				<monospace>TextField</monospace> to <emphasis><strong>You clicked!</strong></emphasis>. This should hopefully demonstrate the crux of &webframework;, 
				your area of concern is reacting to changes within the system: you don't need to worry about storing, sending, decoding and dealing with all
				components. It brings the world of state-full programming to the web.
			</para>
		</section>
		
		<section id="pages.makingchanges">
			<title>Lets make some changes!</title>
			<para>
				First we are going to change the page file. As we are building an application to store a set of tasks, lets add a <monospace>TextView</monospace> 
				component to store the body of the task, a <monospace>Calendar</monospace> component to allow us to pick when the task should be completed by,
				and a <monospace>PopupButton</monospace> to allow us to select how urgent the task is.

			<para>
				We have renamed our TextField, added a TextView with the ID <monospace>TaskContents</monospace> on line 4, a <monospace>Calendar</monospace> called
				<monospace>TaskCompletedBy</monospace> on line 5 and our <monospace>PopupButton</monospace> on line 6. If we refresh this page, we get something that
				should look like this:
			</para>
			<image source="wf_tasks_newmain_noinit.png" />
			<para>
				This is what we need, however, we need to provide some priorities and could probably make the calendar component more useful by setting it to todays
				date. This is done by changing the controller file to look something more like below.
			</para>
			<code lines="on">class MainPage extends GUIKit.Page {
	[component DocumentTitle]; // Automatically bound by webframework

			<para>
				This hooks up to the new components (line 4), sets the date on the calendar component (line 9) and provides a set of priorities to the popup button
				(lines 10-14). How does this look ? Refresh the page and it should look something similar to this:

			<image source="wf_tasks_newmain.png" />

	<section id="storedobjects">
		<title id="storedobjects.title">Database Stored Objects</title>
		<para>
			What is a stored object ? In a nutshell it is a bridge between a ferite class and a table row. You specify the table and the map between the table
			and your instance variables within the object, you can then load and save objects to and from the database. They provide a natural way of abstractly
			interfacing with a relational database. The best way to explain their use is to demonstrate with our tasks example. 
        </para>
        <section id="storedobjects.creating">
            <title>Creating Data</title>
            <para>
    			First we will create a database table: (this one is in a PostgreSQL database)
            </para>
            <image source="wf_tasks_table.png" />
            <para>
                Now we need to write our class: firstly we create a Task.feh in our Support directory and write out stored object map:
            </para>
            <code lines="on">class Task extends Database.StoredObject {
	string title = '';
	string contents = '';

	constructor {
		super( 'tasks', [
			'title' => 'title',
			'contents' => 'contents',
			'completeby' => 'completedBy',
			'priority' => 'priority'
		] );
	}
} </code>
            <para>
                There are a couple of things to note: line 1 shows the class extending <monospace>Database.StoredObject</monospace>, line 8-13 shows the parent
                constructor being called. The first argument is the name of the database table to use and raises an interesting point. The table we created
                was called <monospace>tasks_tasks</monospace> but we call it <monospace>tasks</monospace>, this is because &webframework; assumes all tables
                are prefixed with the application name - this ultimately reduces the number of conflicts between applications. The second argument to the 
                parent constructor is an associated array where the keys are the names of the database columns and the value is the local variable to attach
                it to. It is now ready for use.
            </para>
            <para>
                Secondly we need to tell our application source about our new:
            </para>
            <code>uses "Support/Task";</code>
            <para>
                We can now use our Task class in our page file. The aim is to, when the <monospace>Add</monospace> button is clicked, to create an object and
                the save it to our database. How tricky is that ? Not very. Lets modify our click handler and see how we use the object:
            </para>
            <code lines="on">function button_clicked( object sender, string extra ) {
	object task = new Task();
	task.title = .TaskTitle.textValue();
	task.contents = .TaskContents.textValue();
	task.completedBy = .TaskCompleteBy.date();
	task.priority = .TaskPriority.selectedItem();
	task.saveObject();
} </code>
            <para>
                The above code creates the object and then assigns the various component values from the page to the objects variables. The important line
                is line 7; <monospace>saveObject</monospace> tells the object to flush its values back to the database. This function will, if the object
                already has an id update the object otherwise, as in our case, it will create a new row within the database and grab its id. For any subsequent
                saves the object will use the newly created row and update it. This means that clicking <monospace>Add Task</monospace> in the form below:
            </para>
            <image source="wf_form_filled.png" />
            <para>
                Will generate the following database row:
            </para>
            <image source="wf_dbdata.png" />
            <para>
                Having stored the data, it is now necessary to explore how to get it back!
            </para>
        </section>
        
        <section id="storedobjects.gettingitback">
            <title>Getting It Back</title>
            <para>
            	<monospace>Database.StoredObject</monospace> provides a number of strategies for getting your data back. We will start by looking at 
				at the cleanest approaches and then delve into the dark dank world that is the raw SQL query. 			
			</para>
			<para>
				To fetch an object back we can use the <monospace>loadObject</monospace> function. This takes the id of the object you wish to load,
				queries the database and populates the objects' variables. 
			</para>
			<code>object task = new Task();
task.loadObject(2);</code>
			<para>
				There are a number of other variations on the same theme that have the same effect. It is important to note the <monospace>loadCached</monospace>
				(line 3) has an extra feature: if you load the same object twice it will only query the database once, potentially reducing the number of 
				database hits significantly.				 
			</para>
			<code lines="on">object t1 = new Task(2);
object t2 = Task.load(2);
object t3 = Task.loadCached(2);</code>
			<para>
				Loading an object directly is useful, however it is often the case that you don't know what the id is for an object or you wish to
				output a list of objects. To get the list of objects of a certain type, you simply use the function <monospace>objectList</monospace>.
            </para>
			<code>array list = Task.objectList();</code>
			<para>
				This will fetch all the task objects out of our database and return an array of them. There is a variation of this function called
				<monospace>objectListWhere</monospace> that provides the ability to supply a SQL <monospace>WHERE</monospace> clause. There is
				another variation called <monospace>objectListWhereOrder</monospace> which allows you to specify ordering information. 
				For instance, you may only want to retrieve all objects that have a certain priority:
			</para>
			<code>array list1 = Task.objectListWhere('Priority=2');
array list2 = Task.objectListWhereOrder('Priority=2','CompleteBy ASC");</code>
			<para>
				The other option is to talk to the database directly. This is useful when you have a very complicated query that results in 
				wanting to load stored objects. First lets look at an example and then go through it: 
			</para>
			<code lines="on">array list = [];		
string query = "SELECT * FROM ${Database.table('tasks')} ORDER BY CompleteBy ASC";
Database.query( query ) using ( array row ) {
	list[] = Task.load(row);
}; </code>
			<para>
				There are a number of points to be covered:
				<list>
					<list-item>
						<para>
							Line 2: <monospace>Database.table</monospace> is used to get the correct table name. It has been mentioned that &webframework;
							does table name prefixing to remove conflicts across applications, <monospace>Database.table</monospace> will, given the
							application specific name, return a string that has the correct table name. In our example it'll return 
							<monospace>tasks_tasks</monospace>.
						</para>
					</list-item>
					<list-item>
						<para>
							Line 3: <monospace>Database.query</monospace> allows you to run a SQL query. If you do not provide a <monospace>using</monospace>
							block, the function will return the database result object (see the <monospace>dbi</monospace> documentation). If you do
							provide a using block, it must take a single argument that will be an array holding the current row information.
						</para>
					</list-item>
					<list-item>

							row! This means that you can easily load an object from an array.

				Using these mechanisms we can now put a list of objects in the tasks applications and make it useful!

		<title>Pages Reloaded: Templates</title>
		<para>
			There are two topics under the same template roof that will be covered here. How to change the default template to have your
			own custom style and using the template module apis within &webframework;.
		</para>

		<section id="pages2.maintemplate">
			<title>Page Templates</title>
			<para>
				When &webframework; builds the final html for display, it asks the page controller for the name of the template to use.
				This is done by calling the <strong>static</strong> <monospace>getWrapperTemplateName()</monospace> function which, by default, 
				returns "Default". When changing the template you have one of two choices, either change the template name or just override the 
				default template. We will chose the second option.
			</para>
			<para>
				The first thing we do is create a directory called <monospace>Default.template</monospace> in our <monospace>Resources</monospace>
				directory. We also create a CSS, HTML and Images directory within it. Within the HTML directory we create <monospace>PageHeader.html</monospace>
				and a <monospace>PageFooter.html</monospace> files.
			</para>
			<image source="wf_tasks_defaulttemplate.png" />
			<para>
				The we shall create a bare basic template for the page header. There are a few things to note, because
				when combined with the page file, &webframework; uses the file as a valid xml document which is	processed by the component 
				and xhtml translation engine. For this to work cleanly it is important to add some non-optional extra mark up. The first line must
				always be present as well as the extra attributes in the <monospace>html</monospace> tag.
			</para>

			<para>
				Combined with the simple page footer:

			<code><![CDATA[	</body>
</html>]]></code>
			<para>
				We are presented with something that looks like this (note the heading and the lack of background):
			</para>
			<image source="wf_tasks_newtemplate.png" />
			<para>
				If you have CSS or images that you wish to reference in your template you are faced with a slight problem. How do you know where
				the application is within the system ? Well, this is the 1% where we can put some code in the template. This is naughty and 
				cleaner mechanisms are being experimented with, in the mean time we will let you into a secret, the generated page is pushed through
				<monospace>embfer</monospace>. So we can put some embfer tags into our source. The code below shows two examples of how to use
				<monospace>uriForTemplateResource</monospace> function to generate a url for a resource. Lines 1-3 are the embedding of a css 
				style sheet and line 4 is an image.
			</para>
			<code><![CDATA[<style type="text/css" media="screen">
    @import url( ]]><strong><![CDATA[<?= uriForTemplateResource('Default') ?>]]></strong><![CDATA[</strong>/CSS/style.css );
</style>
<img src="]]><strong><![CDATA[<?= uriForTemplateResource('Default') ?>]]></strong><![CDATA[/Images/Logo.png" />]]></code>
			<para>
				It it important to note that due to the caching system that &webframework; employs, when you change a templates header or footer,
				you must <monospace>touch</monospace> all the pages that use it. This is because checking on every page load for a template load
				can be very costly. This can be made more autonomous but using Cache Triggers which is covered later. Having just touched the
				main page in <monospace>tasks</monospace>, it is now possible to see an image I added:
			</para>
			<image source="wf_tasks_withlogo.png" />
		</section>
		<section id="pages2.smalltemplates">
			<title>Small Templates</title>
			<para>
				Small templates are used in all components but can be used anywhere within the system. They use the <monospace>template</monospace>
				module to render and are fast and easy to use. We will look at how to use the template system by going back to <monospace>tasks</monospace>
				and cleaning up the rendered tasks within our lists.
			</para>
			<para>
				First we need to create our template. We shall call it Task.template and create a blank file in <monospace>Resources/Templates</monospace>.
				It needs to have some content otherwise we will end up with no output, so lets re-create our existing output with a few changes.
			</para>
			<code><![CDATA[[templateValues:
<b>[title]</b> <br />
<small>Complete by: [completeby] &middot; Priority: <b>[priority]</b></small> <br />
<blockquote style="border-left:2px dotted #666;margin-left:5px;padding-left:5px;">
	[content]
</blockquote> ]]]></code>
			<para>
				So what does the above mean ? Small templates use the template module to generate populated files. All values are passed into the
				template through an associative array called <monospace>templateValues</monospace>. To populate the above template we need some code
				that looks something like this:
			</para>
			<code>array values = [];
string ouput = '';
values['title'] = 'A Title';
values['content'] = 'Some content';
values['completeby'] = 'A Date';
values['priority'] = 'A Priority';
output = GUIKit.ViewTemplate.render('Task', values);</code>
			<para>
				The important line in the code is line 7. It uses <monospace>GUIKit.ViewTemplate</monospace> and calls the render function on it.
				The first argument is always the name of the template to use: our template file is called 'Task.template' so we pass 'Task' as 
				the name. The second argument is the associated values array. Executing the above code will produce this output:
			</para>
			<code><![CDATA[<b>A Title</b> <br />
<small>Complete by: A Date &middot; Priority: <b>A Priority</b></small> <br />
<blockquote style="border-left:2px dotted #666;margin-left:5px;padding-left:5px;">
	Some content
</blockquote>
]]></code>
			<para>
				The template module provides a good template language and it is recommended that you refer to the documentation for it. Our next
				step is to transition our <monospace>renderForItem</monospace> function to use the template code. The modified function looks like
				this:
			</para>
			<code>function renderForItem( object sender, number index ) {
	object task = .taskList[index];
	array values = [];
	values['title'] = task.title;
	values['content'] = task.contents;
	values['completeby'] = Date.date(task.completedBy).format(Config.Defaults.DateFormat);
	values['priority'] = .TaskPriority.labelForItem(task.priority);
	return GUIKit.ViewTemplate.render('Task', values);
} </code>
			<para>
				The code is much cleaner and it is more obvious what is being attempted by it. We have also removed the display code from our logic
				which means that we no longer need worry about presentation or potentially breaking code if we need to make presentation
				changes. There are no good reasons why you shouldn't use this mechanism. If you are concerned about loading the template for
				each item within the list - don't - the <monospace>ViewTemplate</monospace> only ever loads a template once. The only thing left to 
				do is see what the output looks like:
			</para>
			<image source="wf_tasks_listtemplate.png" />
		</section>
	</section>
	
	<section id="components">
		<title id="components.title">Components: 42</title>
		<para>
			You have seen how to use components: drop their tag in the page file and link to them using the <monospace>[component]</monospace> directive
			in your controller class. The new trick we are going to learn is how to make our own components. 
		</para>
		<para>
			As with any good object oriented approach to development, the majority of the logic for a component is wrapped up in the
			<monospace>GUIKit.View</monospace> class and for container components there is some extra logic <monospace>GUIKit.Container</monospace> class.
			All components must inherit from either of these classes and be placed within the <monospace>GUIKit</monospace> namespace. The namespace
			part is critical, when &webframework; is parsing the page files and encounters a component, it will look in the <monospace>GUIKit</monospace>
			for a class with the same name. e.g. <![CDATA[<wf:Button />]]> maps to the class <monospace>GUIKit.Button</monospace>.
		</para>
		<para>
			The following sub-sections cover the fundamental basics of standard and container components and it is recommended that you, upon
			completing them, go an review the components that are shipped with &webframework;. They can be found in the 
			<monospace>Server/Suppoprt/GUIKit/Components</monospace> directory.
		</para>
		
		<section id="components.simple">
			<title>Standard Component</title>
			<para>
				To start with we will create an empty component in the file <monospace>Support/Components/ExampleComponent.feh</monospace>, 
				making sure to add a <monospace>uses</monospace> statement to our <monospace>App.fe</monospace>.
			</para>
			<code>namespace modifies GUIKit {
	class ExampleComponent extends GUIKit.View {

	}	
}</code>
			<para>
				The first thing we will do is add it to the top of our page file, and we will give it a text value as well. It should look something 
				like this:
			</para>
			<code><![CDATA[<wf:ExampleComponent TextValue="This is an example component!" />]]></code>
			<para>
				Refreshing the page will actually output nothing, which isn't surprising because we haven't told it how to draw our component to the page.
				This is as easy as providing a <monospace>render</monospace> function which returns the output. We will check whether we are supposed to
				be visible or not, and simply return a bold version of our text value.
			</para>
			<code>function render() {
	if( .visible() )
		return HTML.bold( .textValue() );
	return ''; // We are not visible
} </code>
			<para>
				If we refresh our page, we should get something that looks like this:
			</para>
			<image source="wf_tasks_examplecomponent1.png" />
			<para>
				Drawing is easy, but how can we have our own attributes on components like <monospace>TextValue</monospace> ? For each attribute it is 
				necessary create a function called <monospace>set<strong>AttributeName</strong></monospace>. When &webframework; sees an attribute
				within a component tag it will check the component for a function that matches the attribute and will call it with the value in the
				tag. For instance, the attributed <monospace>TextValue="foo"</monospace> will cause the <monospace>setTextValue</monospace> function 
				to be called with the string <monospace>foo</monospace> as the argument. There are already a number of attributes for the existing
				components which can be seen in the api documentation. We will create a custom attribute called counter, it will count up each time
				the page is loaded and allow us to set the initial value. When the component is rendered it will output the value at the end of our
				string. With some changes the component code looks something like this (with the new function in bold):
			</para>
			<code>namespace modifies GUIKit {
	class ExampleComponent extends GUIKit.View {

		<strong>number count = 0;
		function setCount( string count ) {
			.count = count.toNumber();
		}</strong>

		function render() {
			if( .visible() )
				return <strong>"<![CDATA[<b>]]>${.textValue()}<![CDATA[</b>]]>: ${.count}";</strong>
			return ''; // We are not visible
		}
	}	
} </code>
			<para>
				We can modify our page file:
			</para>
			<code><![CDATA[<wf:ExampleComponent TextValue="The answer is" Count="42" />]]></code>
			<para>
				Which refreshing the page in the browser gives us:
			</para>
			<image source="wf_tasks_examplecomponent2.png" />
			<para>
				And refreshing will always give us 42. Which isn't what we want. To get our achieved goal of it automatically counting up we need to
				delve into the state storing mechanism of &webframework;. Every time a page of components are generated, &webframework; will also ask
				each and every component for their current state, or in &webframework; parlance, their attributes. &webframework; will call the
				<monospace>generateAttributes</monospace> on each component which returns an associative array of attribute names to values. We need to
				tap into this function and add out new attribute into the mix. When the components are loaded up, &webframework; will automatically
				call the right function to setup the component again (in exactly the same way attributes from the xml tags are given to the component).
				Our function looks like this:
			</para>
			<code>function generateAttributes() {
	array attrs = super.generateAttributes();
	attrs['Count'] = "${.count}";
	return attrs;
} </code>
			<para>
				Modifying the <monospace>render</monospace> to increment <monospace>count</monospace> each, and every time, the component is drawn
				makes it look something like this:
			</para>
			<code>function render() {
	if( .visible() ) {
		<strong>.count = .count + 1;</strong>
		return "<![CDATA[<b>]]>${.textValue()}<![CDATA[</b>]]>: ${.count}";
	}
	return ''; // We are not visible
} </code>
			<para>
				Now, when ever anything is done on the page, the counter will increment. For instance, adding a new task or selecting something from
				the list. So you should not only be able to create a component, get it to render, add custom attributes, but also retain state across
				page loads removing the need for anyone using the component to require the knowledge of the inner workings of the implementation. There
				is one more point to cover before we venture into the realm that is the container components and that is using small templates. In the 
				previous chapter we had to do build an array of values to be given to the template engine. With components there is a short cut, because
				we already generate an array of attributes for the storage of information in the state saving part of &webframework;, we can recycle that
				information. There is a function provided by the <monospace>GUIKit.View</monospace> class called 
				<monospace>generateTemplateAttributes</monospace>. This function called the existing <monospace>generateAttributes</monospace>, does some
				processing and returns a more template friendly set of values. The function takes the name of the default style class for the component
				and will use that if a custom <monospace>StyleClass=""</monospace> attribute isn't found. It also provides event handler code in a
				key called <monospace>EventCode</monospace>. So how do we invoke a component template draw ? First (as always) we create a template and,
				following convention, we name it <monospace>Resources/Templates/Component<emphasis>Name</emphasis>.template</monospace> which in our
				case is <monospace>Resources/Templates/ComponentExampleComponent.template</monospace> and it looks like this:
			</para>
			<code><![CDATA[[templateValues: 
	<span class="[StyleClass]"><b>[TextValue]</b>: <i><u>[Count]</u></i></span>
]]]> </code>
			<para>
				We now modify our render function to take advantage of this template. It is also important to note that we don't directly invoke
				the <monospace>GUIKit.ViewTemplate.render</monospace> function, this is because the component class allows the user of the component
				to overload the name of the template to use when rendering the function. Calling <monospace>templateRender</monospace> in the 
				component will check to see if this is the case and change the template used. This is useful in case you wanted, for instance, two
				different coloured buttons - a different template for each one and the name of the template given in a <monospace>Template=""</monospace>
				attribute within the page file.
			</para>
			<code>function render() {
	if( .visible() ) {
		array values = .generateTemplateAttributes('ExampleComponent');
		.count = .count + 1;
		return .templateRender( 'ComponentExampleComponent', values );
	}
	return ''; // We are not visible
} </code>
			<para>
				The last thing to cover with standard components is event handling. We will add some event handling so that the number 
				only increments when we click on the component. We need to add two functions <monospace>initialiseComponent</monospace> where
				we will register our event handler, and a function <monospace>incrementCounter</monospace> which will, as the name suggests,
				increment the counter. We also remove the <monospace>.count = .count + 1;</monospace> line from the render function.
			</para>
			<code>function initialiseComponent() {
	super.initialiseComponent();
	.registerEventHook( self, "incrementCounter", GUIKit.EvClick );
}
function incrementCounter( object sender, string extra ) {
	.count++;
} </code>
			<para>
				With the code in place we just need to edit our template to have the event code. This is stored in the key 
				<monospace>EventCode</monospace>, we also get the style settings using <monospace>Style</monospace> as the 
				<monospace>View</monospace> class changes the default cursor for the mouse over the component to a hand to indicate
				that the component can be clicked. Our new template looks like this and refreshing the page will allows us to click
				on the component to change the value.
			</para>
			<code><![CDATA[[templateValues: 
	<span class="[StyleClass]" [EventCode] style="[Style]">
		<b>[TextValue]</b>: <i><u>[Count]</u></i>
	</span>

		<section id="components.container">
			<title><strike>[Epic]</strike> Container Components</title>
			<para>
				A container component is slightly more tricky to play with than a normal component but that is because they can do more
				interesting tricks. There are a number of container components that ship with &webframework; with the most notable being
				the <monospace>TabView</monospace> component that makes adding tab based content a breeze. As with a standard component,
				we shall lead by example. Creating a new component in <monospace>Support/Components/ExampleContainer.feh</monospace> we
				end up with a basic container that looks like this:
			</para>
			<code>namespace modifies GUIKit {
	class ExampleContainer extends GUIKit.Container {

		function renderContainerStart() {
			return '<div>Container Start</div>';
		}
		function renderContainerEnd() {
			return '<div>Container End</div>';
		}
	}
} </code>
			<para>
				When it comes to rendering a container, &webframework; will call <monospace>renderContainerStart</monospace>, process the
				container contents, then call <monospace>renderContainerEnd</monospace>. To use the component, we add the source file to
				<monospace>App.fe</monospace> and put some more tags in our page file.
			</para>
			<code><![CDATA[<wf:ExampleContainer>
	Some html <b>tags</b> <i>italic</i>
</wf:ExampleContainer>]]></code>
			<para>
				When we refresh the page we end up with something that looks like this:
			</para>
			<image source="wf_tasks_container1.png" />
			<para>
				Great! We can put stuff before and after some other page details. Not very exciting is it ? Never fear, &webframework; has
				many tricks up its sleeve. The first thing we will look at is controlling whether or not the contents of the container
				should be rendered by the page. To do this we implement the function <monospace>renderContainerContents</monospace> by default
				it will return the same result as calling the function <monospace>visible</monospace>. We will add a new attribute to the
				component called <monospace>Expanded</monospace> which, when true will render the contents of the component, otherwise it
				wont.
			</para>
			<code>namespace modifies GUIKit {
	class ExampleContainer extends GUIKit.Container {

		number expanded = 1;
		function setExpanded( string value ) {
			.expanded = .stringToBoolean(value);
		}
		function generateAttributes() {
			array attrs = super.generateAttributes();
			attrs['Expanded'] = (.expanded ? 'true' : 'false');
			return attrs;
		}
		<strong>function renderContainerContents() {
			return .expanded;
		}</strong>
		function renderContainerStart() {
			if( .expanded )
				<![CDATA[return "<div><b>-</b> <u>${.textValue()}</u></div><blockquote>";]]>
			else
				<![CDATA[return "<div><b>+</b> <u>${.textValue()}</u></div>";]]>
		}
		function renderContainerEnd() {
			if( .expanded )
				<![CDATA[return "</blockquote>";]]>
			return '';
		}
	}
} </code>
			<para>
				We also need to modify our page file accordingly:
			</para>
			<code><![CDATA[<wf:ExampleContainer TextValue="Top" Expanded="true">
	Some html <b>tags</b> <i>italic</i>
</wf:ExampleContainer>

<wf:ExampleContainer TextValue="Bottom" Expanded="false">
	If I was a cool person, I'd not mention WoW here.
</wf:ExampleContainer>]]> </code>
			<image source="wf_tasks_container2.png" />
			<para>
				This renders to be something like the above. Pretty cool isn't it. <strong>BUT</strong> the magic doesn't stop there. The
				next thing we will look at is attaching an event handler to the component so that clicking the text will expand and
				collapse the component! First we register an event hook, then we write a event handler and then we smile. All we need to
				do is add the following functions to our component:
			</para>
			<code>function initialiseComponent() {
	super.initialiseComponent();
	.registerEventHook( self, "toggleExpand", GUIKit.EvClick );
}
function toggleExpand( object sender, string extra ) {
	.expanded = not .expanded;
} </code>
			<para>
				<monospace>initialiseComponent</monospace> is the init function called when the component is first initialised and is the 
				component equivalent to <monospace>initialiseComponents</monospace> in the Page-Contoller classes.
				We need to add the event code to our output, we do this by using the <monospace>eventHooks</monospace> function (don't
				worry we will finish this up with templates). We also use the function <monospace>styleSheetSettings</monospace> which 
				will generate a set of CSS style attributes based up the component state, the most important one we use is the change
				of the pointer to a hand.
			</para>
			<code>function renderContainerStart() {
	if( .expanded )
		return <![CDATA["<div ${.eventHooks()} style=\"${.styleSheetSettings()}\">
				<b>-</b> <u>${.textValue()}</u>
			</div><blockquote>";]]>
	else
		return <![CDATA["<div ${.eventHooks()} style=\"${.styleSheetSettings()}\">
				<b>+</b> <u>${.textValue()}</u>
			</div>";]]>
} </code>
			<para>
				When we refresh, we get this: 
			</para>
			<image source="wf_tasks_container3.png" />
			<para>
				The next facility that container classes provide is the ability to post-process the contents of the container before it
				is outputted. What does this allow us to do ? Well, say we want to make everything uppercase within our container, this
				is a trivial task. There is a function <monospace>preProcessContainerContents</monospace> that gets called with the fully
				rendered contents of the container. By default the function returns the contents untouched, however, we will change that.
			</para>
			<code>function preProcessContainerContents( string value ) {
	return String.toUpper(value);
} </code>
			<para>
				This changes our output to be like this:
			</para>
			<image source="wf_tasks_container4.png" />
			<para>
				As easy as this ability to change the contents is, it poses some issues. What happens if there is another component within
				us ? What happens when you make changes that ends up breaking the page ? These are questions that you need to be asking
				yourself when considering the change. There is a solution that is provided by &webframework;, when the page is being passed
				it will call the function <monospace>handleChildren</monospace> providing an array of child nodes 
				(<monospace>XML.Element</monospace> objects). We can use this mechanism to delete nodes from the parsed tree before they
				even get registered as components. How is this used ? For instance the <monospace>TabView</monospace> component will remove
				any nodes from below it in the document tree that are not <monospace>TabViewItem</monospace> components. We will give
				an example of this by removing all top level components from within our container.
			</para>
			<code>function handleChildren( array children, object renderEngine ) {
	Array.each( children ) using ( child ) {
		array a = child.getNamespace();
		if( Array.keyExists( a, "wf" ) )
			child.removeSelf();
	};
} </code>
			<para>
				The above code goes through each element within the array, checks to see if it is part of the <monospace>wf</monospace>
				namespace and if it is it will remove it from the tree of nodes. We can take a look at the effect of having this function
				by comparing the difference of the output of this page code:
			</para>
			<code><![CDATA[<wf:ExampleContainer TextValue="Top" Expanded="true">
	Some html <b>tags</b> <i>italic</i> 
	<wf:Button TextValue="I Shouldn't Be Here Today" />
</wf:ExampleContainer> ]]> </code>
			<para>
				With out the <monospace>handleChildren</monospace> implemented within the component class:
			</para>
			<image source="wf_tasks_container5.png" />
			<para>
				When the function is enabled we are returned to our previous state:
			</para>
			<image source="wf_tasks_container4.png" />
			<para>
				It is important to note that this will <strong>only</strong> happen when the page is being re-cached. The last thing that
				we need to do is transition the component over to using template to generate view code. We create two templates called
				<monospace>ComponentExampleContainerStart.template</monospace> and <monospace>ComponentExampleContainerEnd.template</monospace>, 
				placing them in our templates directory. We then fill them out like below (The 'Start' and 'End' template respectively). It 
				is important to note that we use a template conditional to output the blockquote tag.
			</para>
			<code><![CDATA[[templateValues:
	<div [EventCode] style="[Style]">
		<b>[IsExpanded:-][!IsExpanded:+]</b> 
		<u>[TextValue]</u>
	</div>
	[IsExpanded: <blockquote> ]
]]]></code>
			<code><![CDATA[[templateValues:
	[IsExpanded: </blockquote>]
]]]> </code>
			<para>
				With the templates written we now need to hook them up to the render functions. They look like below and use a variation
				of <monospace>templateRender</monospace>. 
			</para>
			<code>function renderContainerStart() {
	array values = .generateTemplateAttributes('ExampleContainer');
	values['IsExpanded'] = .expanded;
	return .templateRender( 'ComponentExampleContainer', 'Start', values );
}
function renderContainerEnd() {
	array values = .generateTemplateAttributes('ExampleContainer');
	values['IsExpanded'] = .expanded;
	return .templateRender( 'ComponentExampleContainer', 'End', values );
} </code>
			<para>
				As with the standard component, a user could use the <monospace>Template=""</monospace>
				attribute. That works fine for a component that only uses one, but what about out container ? We use variants on the template.
				Our default templates are <monospace>ComponentExampleContainerStart</monospace> and <monospace>ComponentExampleContainerEnd</monospace>,
				this is because we specify the template <monospace>ComponentExampleContainer</monospace> and the variant 'Start' or 'End'. If
				someone was to change our template using <monospace>Template="GreenContainer"</monospace>, rendering would not break because
				it'd look for the variants <monospace>GreenContainerStart.template</monospace> and 
				<monospace>GreenContainerEnd.template</monospace>. Powerful flexibility at little cost. When viewing the template version of
				the component, the output should be identical to the previous version.

			Good communication is the <emphasis>key</emphasis> to a long and happy life. Well, maybe not the <emphasis>key</emphasis>, but it helps.
			&webframework; provides a number of tools that allow you to, at the moment, localise a web application to different languages. More tools
			are planned in the future, such as date and currency formatting. There are two parts: building the translation catalog and loading it, the first
			is the tricky part and the second bit is easy. &webframework; provides a script within the <monospace>Tools</monospace> directory 
			called <monospace>i18nGenerateStrings.fe</monospace>. The program will generate a strings file for the entire application which map the original
			strings to a translated string, the generated file is placed within the application directory <monospace>Resources/Strings</monospace>
			and is called <monospace>Master.strings.fe</monospace> (It is copies of this file that need to be translated). 
		</para>
		<para>
			Firstly we will look at how to tag strings so they make it into the strings.fe file, some guidelines on then translating the file and then 
			how to use it within the running application.
		</para>
		<section>
			<title>Tagging Strings</title>
			<para>
				&webframework; provides three mechanisms for tagging a string to be translated and a tool to scan the applications source and
				provide translate-able strings.
				<list>
					<list-item>
						<para>
							All <monospace>TextValue=""</monospace> attributes within the page files will be tagged for translation. &webframework; will
							create a list of all the <monospace>TextValue</monospace> strings within a page and store them to be used by the 
							<monospace>i18nGenerateStrings.fe</monospace> tool.
						</para>
					</list-item>
					<list-item>
						<para>
							There is a function within the framework called <monospace>I()</monospace>. When the function is run takes a string and will 
							return the translated string from the loaded catalog. It is very important to note how this function must be used for the
							internationalisation tools to pick up the string when scanning the source code. There is only one argument and that is a 
							string constant wrapped in single quotes <monospace>''</monospace>. You must not use double quoted strings, the reason for
							this restriction is that double quoted string are mutable due to variable substitution, this could have odd side effects
							when being expanded and also increases the complexity for the translators.
						</para>
						<code>
I('This is correct')
I("This is not correct") </code>
						<para>
							Using this function call we can update our application, where we set the priority for the task manually, so that the list
							can be translated:
						</para>
						<code>
.TaskPriority.setDataSource( [
	[ 1, <strong>I('Low')</strong> ],
	[ 2, <strong>I('Medium')</strong> ],
	[ 3, <strong>I('High')</strong> ] ] );</code>
						<para>
							The restrictions on the input string unfortunately provides a little conundrum: how can we build dynamic strings that are easy to 
							translate? There is a an answer, &webframework; provides a <monospace>String.expand()</monospace> function that provides a nice 
							clean way of expanding strings. We shall start off with an example:
						</para>
						<code>
string s = String.expand('A <strong>{0}</strong> Of How To <strong>{1:action}</strong>', 
						 'Guide', 
						 'Dance On The Roof'); </code>
						<para>
							The above code will expand the string to <emphasis>A Guide Of How To Dance On The Roof</emphasis>. The important parts of
							the format string are in bold; they are called anchors. An anchor consists of a number and an optional note, in the above
							example there are two anchors. The number denotes the location of the variable to substitute starting at the 0 index. So
							the first item after the string will be 0, the seoncond 1 and so on. The note is not necessary, it is there to provide
							context to the person reading the string as to what is going to be placed there, this is useful in situations where ordering
							matters. For instance, in displaying currency, in the US, the symbol goes before the total, in Sweden, it goes after.
						</para>
						<code>
I('Total amount: {0:currency symbol}{1:amount}').expand(
				getCurrencySymbol(), getAmount()) </code>
						<para>
							The English version is fine and would translate to something like: <monospace>Total amount: $100</monospace>. However, translated 
							to Swedish we have to re-order the arguments and the string would look like this:
						</para>
						<code>
'Summa: {1:amount}{0:currency symbol}</code>
						<para>
							Resulting in an expansion that looks like: <monospace>Summa: 100kr</monospace>. The reason this method is excellent is because
							no code has had to change as a result of the translation.
						</para>
					</list-item>
					<list-item>
						<para>
							&i18ntags; tags are the third tool that can be used. This allows you to in page and template files, tag the text that should 
							be translated. This allows you to, in an xml friendly fashion, get the same effect at using the <monospace>I('')</monospace> function
							call. It is <strong>important</strong> to note that the tag can <strong>not</strong> have any other tags within it. So how is this
							used? Lets refer to our tasks application:
						</para>
						<code>
<![CDATA[<wf:ExampleContainer TextValue="Bottom" Expanded="false">
	<i18n>If I was a cool person, I'd not mention a computer game here.</i18n>
</wf:ExampleContainer>

<i18n>This is translated text</i18n>, but this isn't.]]></code>
						<para>
							In the above example, the strings <emphasis>If I was a cool person, I'd not mention a computer game here.</emphasis> and 
							<emphasis>This is translated text</emphasis> will be put within the <monospace>strings.fe</monospace> file. These tags can be
							used within <monospace>.template</monospace> files with &webframework; automatically translating the tags on the fly through
							use of <monospace>ViewTemplate</monospace> functions.
						</para>
					</list-item>
				</list>
			</para>
			<para>
				Having tagged up our application we need to make sure that &webframework; has generated the necessary files for all the pages, at the moment
				this requires you to visit each page within the system, this will cause &webframework; to correctly generate the per-page cache strings. Once
				this is done we can run <monospace>i18nGenerateStrings.fe</monospace>. This is run from within the Tools directory and takes the application
				name as the only argument. For our tasks application we do the following:
			</para>

				Lines 12-25 show the application walking through the application looking for any template or ferite source files which it scans for

			<title>The strings file and how to translate</title>
			<para>
				The <monospace>Master.strings.fe</monospace> is actually a very simple ferite script, it returns an associative array that maps strings
				to translated strings. The file for our tasks applications looks like this:
			</para>
			<code>
<![CDATA[return [
	'Add New Task' => 'Add New Task',
	'Add Task' => 'Add Task',

			<para>
				Translation is as straight forward as replacing the strings to the right of the <![CDATA[=>]]> with the translated string, saving the
				file in a UTF-8 format in a directory denoting the language name in a file called <monospace>APPLICATION.strings.fe</monospace>. So in the case of our application,
			 	to translate to Swedish, we would save the file as <monospace>tasks.strings.fe</monospace> in a directory called <monospace>se</monospace> in the <monospace>Resources/Strings</monospace> directory.

			<title>Loading A Catalog</title>
			<para>
				Loading a strings catalog is easy, you use the function call <monospace>I18N.loadCatalog(language);</monospace>, where language is a string of
				what language you wish to load. This should be done in the constructor for your application object. For instance, in our tasks application:
			</para>
			<code>
class tasksApplication extends Application {
	constructor {
		super("tasks");
		.registerPage("Main");
		redirects.register( Application.NoAction, "Main" );		
		<strong>I18N.loadCatalog( 'se' );</strong>
	}
} </code>

		<para>
			&webframework; provides a several closely related mechanisms for doing Asynchronous Javascript And XML (AJAX) and groups them under the
			technology called Muliple Channel AJAX Model (MCAM). MCAM allows multiple AJAX requests and responses to be handled by the web application.
			The result is a system that allows you to write your web applications regardless of whether they are going to be using the standard full
			page reload or incremental changes using AJAX. For instance, say you had a button and when you click it the event handler updates a text 
			box with the current time. Webframework knows which components have changed, it will package up changes on the page and send them back. 
			The front end will take the changes and update the web page. None of your code has changed, except the event registration. It contrived 
			example I'll admit, but it demonstrates the core functionality.
		</para>
		<para>
			Lets start with a page with the old functionality. The page controller should look like this:

}
return TestPage; </code>

			To help with the mental image of what the page looks like:
		</para>
		<image source="wf_ajax_start.png" />
		<para>
			The event flow is as previously described, the SubmitButton is clicked, the page submitted and buttonClicked is called. The next
			task is to turn this into a Web 2.0 AJAX application. Now, watch very carefully, you might miss this: change line 6 in the above page
			controller code to read like this:
		</para>
		<code>.SubmitButton.register<strong>Background</strong>EventHook( self, "buttonClick", GUIKit.EvClick );</code>
		<para>
			The only thing you have to do, is register a background event hook. Apart from that, everything else is handled by webframework. When 
			you refresh the page, you will be able to click on the button, the text box will update but it will all have been done in the background.
			This effect works with webframework watching what components have changed and sending their updated display back to the browser. MCAM
			goes through each change and updates the front end.

				<para>
					A resource is defined as a unique name that can be referred to within program code. Each zone consists of a set of users with a 
					permission level assigned to each one, and a set of named resources which a permission level assigned to each one. Users and 
					resources may be present in as many zones as required. How does the system work ? There are two functions 
					<monospace>userAllowedForResource</monospace> and <monospace>userAllowedForResourceInZone</monospace>. The first takes a
					user object and the name of a resource, checks all zones where the user and resource exist and if the user has a high enough
					level to access that resource. The second function checks the specified zone, for the resource and user match.
